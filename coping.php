                <h2 id="coping_strategies">Healthy Coping Strategies</h2>
                <p>Please be aware that this is not an exhaustive list. These are only some of the many possible coping strategies that are out there.
                Not every coping strategy will work for every person and you may try some that don't work before discovering one that will, but don't up!
                Find what works for you and stick with it. If you can start to develop healthy coping mechanisms and
                    healthy habits, you will find it easier to combat mental illness, maintain a positive attitude and get through the day with ease.</p>

                <p>Important: We are not giving you a diagnosis nor should you ever diagnose yourself with a problem.
                    If you think that you may be struggling with a mental health problem, please contact a licensed professional.</p>
